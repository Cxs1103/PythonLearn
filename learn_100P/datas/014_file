Python is a computer programming language. You may have heard of many popular programming languages, such as the very difficult C language, the very popular java language, the basic language for beginners, the JavaScript language for web programming, and so on.
What language is Python?
You might ask, is it not good to have less code? The cost of less code is the slow running speed. C programs run for 1 second, Java programs may take 2 seconds, and python programs may take 10 seconds.
Is it that the lower the program, the harder it is to learn, and the higher the program, the simpler it is? On the surface, yes, but in very high abstract computing, advanced python programming is also very difficult to learn. Therefore, high-level programming language is not simple.
